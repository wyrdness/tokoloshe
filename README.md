## Overview

The Tokoloshe (also Tikoloshe, Tokolosh) is a dwarf-like creature from Zulu and broader South African folklore, typically described as 2-3 feet tall, hairy, with a grotesque appearance. In some versions, it has only one buttock or leg.

The tokoloshe possesses supernatural powers including **invisibility** (achieved by drinking water), **shape-shifting**, and **superhuman strength**. Traditionally summoned by witch doctors (sangomas) to harm enemies or cause mischief, the tokoloshe is believed to frighten children, cause illness, and commit sexual assaults while invisible.

**This is not humorous folklore but a serious cultural belief** that affects real people's lives. The tokoloshe is often invoked to explain unexplained events, sleep paralysis, night terrors, and assaults. Protection methods include raising beds on bricks (too high for the short creature to reach) and traditional medicines.

The belief remains widespread and active across Southern Africa, with regular news reports and social discussions.
